# Python-Challenge
Challenge 3:  Python

By Brian Guenther

Unfortunately construction in my neighborhood, knocked out the internet to my house twice this week.  Dealing with getting the connection repaired reduced my preparation time and limited the possible aid with the tutor.  This resulted in me working solely on my computer and saving changes locally instead of pushing new versions to GitHub.  I continued to have issues with the git push but the cloning and downloading/uploading works fine.  Fortunately, I also used the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners" by Al Sweigart, which aided in some of the coding.

Working with Tutor (Kourt Bailey).  The main help was in the change directory path for opening the CSV file.  This issue primarily arises when I am running Python through the Explorer Window within Visual Studio in contrast to opening the Python file in the given directory by double clicking or File>Open.  Still exploring (trying to understand) the pros and cons to these approaches.


Regarding PyBank
I am obtaining a slightly different value for the “Average Change” than was presented in the directions.  My independently verified the calculations of my monthly changes and they are correct at both ends of the data set, so it is not currently clear to me why my values differs.  I also need to learn how to deal with the digits output in one of the calculations.

Regarding PyPoll
I had the same issue with output digits on one of the calculations.
